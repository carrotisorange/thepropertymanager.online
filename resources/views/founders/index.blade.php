                My life has never been the same since you came. 
            
                By that, I would like to quote an amazing person, “My days are better since you came.” (for the better experience please close your eyes and do inhale-exhale at least once.)
     
                Believe or not, I’ve never been so closed and attached to any person before. For the past three months that we’ve been constantly talking virtually, I have to admit that I’ve never been so happy. The feeling that I had when I first heard your voice on my phone was irrevocable and ineffable at the same time. As the time goes by and suddenly, we take things to another level, we’ve started to do long night calls as if were in LDR. I was so overwhelmed and for a moment I felt like I was kid again. I was in my comfort place, got nothing to worry about the future and just enjoy the rain and just go with the flow. During those moments, it occurred to me, that this is the sort of thing in life that you’ll never know you need until you experienced it. Some part of me just died only to reborn with enthusiasm and hope. 
                I was the kind of person who was not really into relationships, you know. All those commitments, emotions, responsibilities, idiosyncrasies, and dramas were not my thing. It makes me feel that I’m not in control of my own life, that I won’t be able to things that I want anymore and therefore I’m not gonna grow. But all of those beliefs and perceptions about what relationships looks like suddenly changed, those are just things in my past now. 
                Being with you made me realize that relationship is fun. Having someone whom you can share about your days and life with is priceless and can never be compared to any luxury items and expensive hobbies. 
                Things happen for a reason and for whatever reason why you came into my life, one thing is for sure, I’ll never be the same again and those memories that we had will be treasured forever. And whatever next thing that will happen to us after this night I’ll accept it. I love you baby! Let me be your man.

                This day marks the first month since you let me be your man. Time had flown so fast, and I couldn’t ask for more, well aside from being successful in my career and then, build my company, and be a millionaire, and erect a mansion for my biological family, and the other 101 more which I don’t want to be covered in this letter. (AYYYY HAHAHA). 
                This day is one of the many milestones a couple could ever accomplish, and I’m grateful we made it. I’ve been connected to WIFI for the longest time, but I found the connection with you.
                This day is a very special day for both of us. The relationship that we have is what I want, and I hope what Luke and Leiah will also find. Let’s enjoy our time together and be as bold as we could be as long as we can without compromising our personal dreams and agendas in this wonderful life.
                <br><br>
                P.S. There are lots more to be thankful for than to be stressed about. Just always give your best shot in everything you do to only have to do it once. I’ll be there when it gets difficult. I love you!

                I know you've been going through a lot recently because you're homesick and the pregnancy scare as well, and I just want you to know that I'm in anguish too because I can't do anything to help ease that pain. 
	 I'm lucky I still this last paper from the first letter I gave to you and thought this might cheer you up. This is just freestyle writing. 
	 I'll write everything that pops out on my head. 
	 Please bear with my calligraphy. It's been so long since I wrote you one. Lol
	 You're a strong woman, loving daughter, sweet sister to your siblings and to your pamangkins as well, a good friend, and a thoughtful girlfriend. 
	 From all the stories you told me about your past and your journey, you still survive because I know you're strong. 
	 And in no time, you'll achieve all your dreams, and I hope I'm there when that time comes. 
	 To be honest, I've been busting my ass out to work and even new things just to distract myself. I'm a very secretive person. 
	 I never say anything to anyone but you. You're an exception. But every time, you're gonna get mad and tell me I'm an ungrateful person. 
	 I feel so lost—I kind of question everything about my life. I question my identity.

                I want to start this letter by expressing my gratitude that despite what’s happening in the world right now, we’re here in a beautiful place and can still see, hug, and enjoy ourselves together.
	 This month is, by far, the toughest period in our relationship to the extent that it almost ended. I wanna apologize for ruining your trust, disregarding your feelings, and, most importantly, making you feel that you’re insignificant. 
	 I already learned my lessons, and rest assured that I’ll be more sensitive to your feelings. 
	 Happy monthsarry my love. I love you. Can’t wait to do baking with you. Ayy
