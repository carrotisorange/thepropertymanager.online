          The tenant portal will provide a hassle-free way for tenants to monitor their contracts, bills, payments and report their concerns. 
          All properties are advised to make sure that the tenants' details are accurate to avoid future problems. 
          The portal promises to improve customer service by providing a way for tenants to send their concerns anytime and anywhere, which the employees can address adequately through constant status monitoring. 
          Also, property managers have been restructuring their organizational structure to accommodate this big change. Everyone is expected to participate to ensure the success of the transition. This is just the start of a new level of property management.
